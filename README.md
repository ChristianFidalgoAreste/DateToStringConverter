# DateToStringConverter
## OOP Date to string converter, formatting the date.

Designed with the chain of responsability design pattern, this program was a little kata to practise SOLID and Design Patterns.

## How to use:

### 1. Install typescript

If you want to compile it, just install typescript with `npm i -D typescript`, and then `npx tsc --init`.

### 2. Compile

Compile the project with `npm start`. This *start* script will execute `npx tsc && node compiled/index.js`.
When you compile it, a new folder ***compiled*** will be created, with all the .js files.

---

### 3. Tests

If you want to try out the test, install vitest with `npm i -D vitest`. Then, execute them with `npm test`.
